# ragdoll_Demo
This is a demo video of my ragdoll project. The code can be shared upon request 

### App platform 

Ali Lakhani 20671281 a25lakha openjdk version "12.0.2" macOS 10.13.6 High Sierra (MacBook Pro 2018)
This app was made on Android Studio and works for the Pixcel C on API 29 as required.

### Objective 

This application is a custom ragdoll. The human body ragdoll can be manipulated using direct manipulation. In addition the legs and feet can be enlarged (scaled) using pinch on the device. Other limbs can be rotated with custom restrictions as shown below. There are two resets allowing the user to reset the application with the generic human ragdoll or with the addition of a dog. Both can be manipulated simultaneously! Enjoy :)
